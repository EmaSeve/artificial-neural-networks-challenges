This repository contains the solutions and documentation for two deep learning challenges conducted at **Politecnico di Milano**. The projects address distinct tasks in time-series analysis and computer vision, leveraging advanced neural network architectures to solve classification problems in medical contexts.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. Time-Series Classification (Pain Prediction)
* **Objective:** Multiclass classification of subject pain levels (No Pain, Low Pain, High Pain) using multivariate temporal data, including joint movements and survey responses.
* **Methodology:** The solution implements Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically utilizing GRU and LSTM architectures. 
* **Performance:** The best configuration achieved a validation F1-score of **0.94**.

### 2. Histopathological Image Classification (Molecular Subtypes)
* **Objective:** Classification of histological microscopic images of diseased human tissue into four molecular subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, and Triple Negative.
* **Methodology:** This approach utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically **ResNet-18** with transfer learning. 
* **Performance:** The best configuration achieved a validation F1-score of **0.4403**.
